Due to growing traffic congestion, significant variations in travel time can be seen in Indian cities. This has led to inconsistency and uncertainty about reaching destinations on time. Therefore, average speeds cannot be the only factor in assessing traffic performance. Travel time reliability is a more crucial parameter to evaluate traffic performance considering the inconsistency and uncertainty involved in travel times. The probe vehicle technique is often employed to measure the travel time. However, this technique can yield only a small sample unless huge resources are deployed. Therefore, this paper attempts to develop a travel time reliability-consistency evaluation model (TTRC-EM) for limited and ambiguous information using a novel fuzzy-possibility approach. Two urban corridors, representing arterial and sub-arterial situations, are taken as a case study in Surat, India. The developed model can be applied to evaluate corridor traffic performance and assign a level of service under mixed traffic conditions.
